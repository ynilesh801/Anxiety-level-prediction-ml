# 🧠 Anxiety Level Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts anxiety levels based on behavioral, lifestyle, and health-related features using machine learning classification models.

## 🎯 Objective
To classify individuals into anxiety categories using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Records: 11,000
- Features: Demographics, lifestyle habits, physiological indicators
- Target: Anxiety Level (Bucketed & Binary)

## 🧠 Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## ⚙️ Techniques Applied
- Data preprocessing & encoding
- Feature scaling
- Bucketing strategy
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 🏆 Final Model
 Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Real-time deployment
- Questionnaire-based inputs
- Boosting models
